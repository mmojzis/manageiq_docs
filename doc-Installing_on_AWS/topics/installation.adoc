==== {product-title_short} Requirements

* 44 GB of space on the chosen datastore.
* 12 GB RAM.
* 4 vCPUs.

==== Amazon EC2 Requirements

* An Amazon S3 bucket to store image.
* A VM import service role (IAM role) named `vmimport`.

For information on creating an Amazon S3 bucket and a VM Import Service Role, see the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmimport-image-import.html[Amazon EC2 documentation].

[[uploading-the-appliance-on-amazon-ec2]]
=== Uploading the Appliance to an Amazon S3 Bucket

From your local file system, you can now upload the {product-title_short} appliance VHD image obtained in xref:obtaining-the-appliance[] to the Amazon S3 bucket, using your choice of tool.

=== Configuring Amazon EC2 to Import the Appliance

[IMPORTANT]
====
These are the procedural steps as of the time of writing. For the latest information on importing a virtual machine as an image, see the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmimport-image-import.html[Amazon EC2 documentation].
====

. Install the AWS client on the computer you want to interact with the AWS API from.
+
----
$ pip install awscli
----
+
. Configure and download your AWS secret/access key by following the steps in the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html[Managing Access Keys for Your AWS Account] documentation.
. Configure the AWS client with your access/secret key. For example:
+
----

$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [******]: ACCESS_KEY
AWS Secret Access Key [******]: SECRET_KEY
Default region name [None]:
Default output format [None]:
----
+
. Create the `trust-policy.json` file for the *vmimport* role. For example:
+
----

{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": { "Service": "vmie.amazonaws.com" },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
         "Condition": {
            "StringEquals":{
               "sts:Externalid": "vmimport"
            }
         }
      }
   ]
}
----
+
. Create the *vmimport* role using the `trust-policy.json` file that you just created.
+
----
$ aws iam create-role --role-name vmimport --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This user must have permissions to create and modify IAM roles.
====
. Create the `role-policy.json` file. Be sure to use the exact S3 bucket name. For example:
+
----
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:CreateBucket",
        "s3:DeleteBucket",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_TO_UPLOAD_IMAGE","arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_TO_UPLOAD_IMAGE/*"]
    }, 
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iam:CreateRole",
        "iam:PutRolePolicy"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:CancelConversionTask",
        "ec2:CancelExportTask",
        "ec2:CreateImage",
        "ec2:CreateInstanceExportTask",
        "ec2:CreateTags",
        "ec2:DeleteTags",
        "ec2:DescribeConversionTasks",
        "ec2:DescribeExportTasks",
        "ec2:DescribeExportImageTasks",
        "ec2:DescribeInstanceAttribute",
        "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "ec2:DescribeTags",
        "ec2:ExportImage",
        "ec2:ImportInstance",
        "ec2:ImportVolume",
        "ec2:StartInstances",
        "ec2:StopInstances",
        "ec2:TerminateInstances",
        "ec2:ImportImage",
        "ec2:ImportSnapshot",
        "ec2:DescribeImportImageTasks",
        "ec2:DescribeImportSnapshotTasks",
        "ec2:CancelImportTask"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
----
+
. Apply the *vmimport* role to the {product-title_short} appliance image you uploaded to the S3 bucket.
+
----
$ aws iam put-role-policy --role-name vmimport --policy-name vmimport --policy-document file://role-policy.json
----
+


[[importing-the-appliance-on-amazon-ec2]]
=== Importing the Appliance to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)

To import the appliance:

. Create a containers.json file:
+
----
{
    "Description": " NAME OF IMPORTED SNAPSHOT IN AWS",
    "Format": "vhd",
    "UserBucket": {
        "S3Bucket": "BUCKET WITH UPLOADED .VHD IMAGE",
        "S3Key": "PATH OF .VHD IMAGE"
    }
}
----
+
See the link://docs.aws.amazon.com[AWS documentation] on VM import and export requirements,
such as image formats, instances, volume and file system types, and using regions.
+
. Use the AWS-CLI tools to import a disk as a snapshot. See the
link://docs.aws.amazon.com[AWS documentation] on using VM Import/Export to
import a disk as a snapshot.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can either specify a region, or if not, ensure that the S3 bucket is in the same
region where you want to import the snapshot.
====
+
----
$ aws ec2 import-snapshot --disk-container file://containers.json
----
+
. Check the progress of your snapshot import by running the following command:
+
----
 $ aws ec2 describe-import-snapshot-tasks --import-task-ids SNAPSHOT_ID_GOT_FROM_RESPONSE
----
+
. Create an AMI from the snapshot. See the link://docs.aws.amazon.com[AWS documentation] on
using options with the following command to create and register a Linux AMI from a snapshot.
+
----
 $ aws ec2 register-image
----
